= Magic Kit

Neovim starter kit for working with https://github.com/Olical/conjure[Conjure] and https://github.com/Olical/aniseed[Aniseed], contains everything you need to get started. The goal is for you to take this and modify it to fit your needs, it is _not_ a distribution I'll constantly tweak, it's a starting point you should change as you see fit.

== Requirements

 * git (for cloning the project and managing plugins)
 * Neovim 0.7+

== Installation

[source,bash]
----
# Clone the project into your Neovim configuration directory.
# Make sure you don't have anything here already! Back it up if so!
git clone git@github.com:Olical/magic-kit.git ~/.config/nvim

# Perform the initial sync which will fetch all of the plugins.
# Run then whenever you change the plugin configuration.
~/.config/nvim/script/sync.sh
----

Once done, have a look at `~/.config/nvim/init.lua` to learn about the bootstrap process then `~/.config/nvim/fnl/magic/init.fnl` for the real beginning of your Fennel based configuration. Good luck! Have fun!

== Mappings

If you press a key and then wait, https://github.com/folke/which-key.nvim[which-key] will pop up with suggestions of what you can press next. Here's a few key mappings defined in the configuration to get you started.

 * `<space>` is the https://learnvimscriptthehardway.stevelosh.com/chapters/06.html#leader[leader key] (`<leader>`)
 * `,` is the https://learnvimscriptthehardway.stevelosh.com/chapters/06.html#local-leader[local leader key] (`<localleader>`)
 * `<leader>f...` finds things with https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim[telescope]
 ** Try `<leader>ff` to find files and `<leader>fb` to find buffers, there's a bunch of mappings so you'll have to experiment and rely on which-key
 * `<leader>ut` opens https://github.com/mbbill/undotree[undotree]
